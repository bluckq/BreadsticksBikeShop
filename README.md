The progam is written in Java and uses SQL to store items and invoices.  The program holds inventory for a bike shop.  It holds prices, item amounts, description, and name.  An invoice is created for every purchase.  It uses a GUI and has different layouts for each.  The different layouts are for practice but is not supposed to be a standard UX design.
